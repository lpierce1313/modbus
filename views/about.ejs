          This program is developed to read register data back and forth from the Vortex Mass Meter Simulation. This web server is known as the master. It will control what kind of data is sent back and forth
          from the slave which is the Vortex Mass Meter Simulation. In this Modbus RTU system, the data type, com port, and function code will be specified and the user will receive a response back based on the inputs given.
